Laboratory: Spell-Checking Hawaiian

Pre-Scripting Assignments:
1. export LC_ALL='C'
This command allowed me to change the locale to 'C'.

2. sort /usr/share/dict/words -o words
This command sorted the English words list and placed the file into the
current working directory as 'words'.

3. wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs35L/assign/assign2.html
This command extracted the content of the assignment page into an HTML
file called 'assign2.html'.

4. tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html
This command replaces any character that is not in the alphabet with a
single newline.

5. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html
This command replaces sequences of characters not in the alphabet with a
single newline. The previous command would replace each non-alphabetic
character with a newline, whereas this one would have only 1 newline per
consecutive non-alphabetic characters.

6. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort
This command takes the output of the previous command and sorts it into
alphabetic order.

7. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u
This command is similar to the output of the previous command, but it also
removes any repeat lines. Thus, all the lines printed are unique.

8. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u | comm - words
This command compares what was outputted by the previous command with the 
English sorted list in 'words'. The first column is full of the lines only
in the HTML file, the second column is full of the lines only in 'words', 
and the last column is full of the lines in both files. All of these columns
share a common alphabetic order.

9. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u | comm -23 - words
This command only prints out the first column from the previous command,
which is the column full of the lines only in the HTML file, and not in 
'words'.


Shell Scripting Assignments:
10. wget http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm
This command extracted the contents of the English to Hawaiian dictionary page
into a file called 'hwnwdseng.htm'.

11. buildwords
#!/bin/sh
grep -E '<td>.*<\/td>' | sed '/<td><\/td>/d' > temp.htm
sed 's/<td>\(.*\)<\/td>/\1/g' temp.htm | sed -n 2~2p > temp2.htm
sed 's/<u>\(.\)<\/u>/\1/g' temp2.htm | tr , '\n' > temp3.htm
sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' temp3.htm | tr ' ' '\n' | sed '/^$/d' > temp4.htm
sed "s/\`/'/g" temp4.htm | tr A-Z a-z > temp5.htm
sed "/[^pkmnwlhaeiou']/d" temp5.htm | sort -u
rm temp*

The first line declares the file to be a script file, using the sh shell.
The second line removes everything except <td>someWord</td>.
The third line removes the tags <td> and </td> and only keeps every
other line (only the Hawaiian lines).
The fourth line changes <u>a</a> to a, and commas into newlines.
The fifth line removes blank space and adds newlines between multiple 
words on the same line.
The sixth line converts the grave accent into an apostrophe, and upper-case
characters into lower-case characters.
The seventh line removes any lines that contain non-Hawaiian characters, and 
sorts the entire list.
The eighth line removes the temp files to clean up the mess.

12. Hawaiian Spell-Checker
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < assign2.html | tr -cs "pkmnwlhae'iou" "[\n*]" | 
sort -u | comm -23 - hwords
This command converts the input file into lowercase, replaces non-Hawaiian
words with newlines, sorts them alphabetically, and then compares it to the
Hawaiian words dictionary. It only gives the first column where it lists the
words not in the dictionary (therefore, the misspelled words).

13. English Spell-Checker
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | 
sort -u | comm -23 - words
This command converts the input file into lowercase, replaces non-English
words with newlines, sorts them alphabetically, and then compares it to the
English words dictionary. It only gives the first column where it lists the
words not in the dictionary (therefore, the misspelled words).

14. Testing Spell-Checkers
Number of Misspelled Hawaiian Words in 'hwords': 0

Number of Misspelled Hawaiian Words in 'assign2.html': 198
Number of Misspelled English Words in 'assign2.html': 39
I used wc -l to count the number of misspelled words.

Examples of Words Misspelled as Hawaiian, but not as English:
who, man, name, a, like, line, link, hawaiian, how
Examples of Words Misspelled as English, but not as Hawaiian:
e, halau, i, iau, po, wiki
I redirected the outputs of misspelled words into the other
spell-checker, and used comm -12, instead of comm -23, to 
obtain the correctly spelled words in the other language.
