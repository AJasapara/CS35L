Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

1. wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
This command allowed me to get the coreutils package.

2. tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
This command extracted the package into a coreutils-7.6 folder.

3. ./configure --prefix='/u/cs/ugrad/arpit/Desktop/Lab_3/coreutils-7.6'
This command configured the makefile into the coreutils-7.6 folder.

4. make
This command compiled all the program codes and created executables.

5. make install
This command copied the executables into the system directories,
such as bin.

6. emacs patch_file
This command allowed me to create a patch file, where I pasted the
code that I copied from Padraig Brady's patch website.

7. patch -p1 < patch_file
This command patched the files mentioned in the patch_file (namely 
ls) using the p1 flag, which indicated that the command should ignore 
the first directory in the path for the files needing to be patched.

8. make
This command re-compiled the program codes that were changed, and
created executables.

make[3]: Entering directory '~/Desktop/Lab_3/coreutils-7.6/src'
  CC     ls.o
  CCLD   dir
  CCLD   vdir
  CCLD   ls
make[3]: Leaving directory '~/Desktop/Lab_3/coreutils-7.6/src'
make[2]: Entering directory '~/Desktop/Lab_3/coreutils-7.6/man'
  GEN    dir.1
  GEN    vdir.1
  GEN    ls.1
make[2]: Leaving directory '~/Desktop/Lab_3/coreutils-7.6/man'

The above commmands indicate which files needed to be recompiled.
In particular, we see that the ls file was recompiled, as we expected, 
since our patch mainly applies to this command. 

9. src/ls -l
This command successfully tested the patched ls command, which now
displays the time in the correct UNIX format.

10. bin/ls -l
This command runs the pre-patch ls command, which showed the non-Unix
date format. I ran this command to compare its output to the previous
command.

11. emacs newFile
This command created a new file (as recent as can be). I tested both of the 
above ls commands on this file, and they both worked as expected.

Old Output:
-rw-r--r--  1 arpit csugrad       2 2017-04-18 20:27 newFile

New Output:
-rw-r--r--  1 arpit csugrad       2 Apr 18 20:27 newFile

12. touch -t 201601010000 newFile
This command changed newFile into a file that is a year old, in accordance 
with the spec. I tested both of the above ls commands on this file, 
and they both worked as expected. One noticeable difference between a recent 
file and a file older than one year, is that in standard UNIX format, the 
recent file will display the time, whereas the old file displays the year
instead. THe pre-patch format stays the same regardless of old/new files.

Old Output:
-rw-r--r--  1 arpit csugrad       2 2016-01-01 00:00 newFile

New Output:
-rw-r--r--  1 arpit csugrad       2 Jan  1  2016 newFile
