For this lab my partner acting as the client/server was Sanketh Hegde.
To start this lab we boot up Ubuntu from a disk image loaded onto a USB, 
because we are not allowed to use sudo on SEASNet servers.

1. dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
This command checks for OpenSSH.

2. sudo apt-get install openssh-server
We did not have the OpenSSH-server program so we use this command to 
install it.

3. ssh-keygen
This command essentially generates and authenticates RSA keys for SSH 
connection if someone tries to SSH into my server. I saved the keys in
âˆ¼/.ssh/id_rsa and I set no password for this key.

4. sudo useradd -d /home/sanketh/ -m sanketh
This creates a directory named sanketh within the home directory and adds a
user with username sanketh.

5. sudo passwd sank
This creates the password for the user sanketh, I chose to set the it as sank 
for convenience.

6. cd /home/sanketh
This command enters Sanketh's directory.

7. sudo mkdir .ssh
This command creates an ssh directory to store all the info from the RSA keys.

8. sudo chown -R sanketh .ssh
This command makes Sanketh the owner of his directory.

9. sudo chmod 700 .ssh
This command gives Sanketh the permissions he needs so he can modify this directory.

10. ifconfig
I used this command to obtain my IP address: 164.67.61.118
Sanketh's IP: 169.232.122.177

11. ssh-copy-id -i arpit@169.232.122.177
After my partner had done the above 10 steps, I used this command to copy my public 
key over to his server.

12. ssh-add
This command adds the private key to his ssh-agent so he can decrypt my key, and I 
would not need to type my password in.

13. ssh arpit@169.232.122.177
This command allowed me to enter the server with Sanketh's IP address.

14. mkdir test
This command allowed me to create a test directory to see if we could both see it.

15. emacs test.txt
This command allowed me to create a test file that I put "Waddup Sanketh" in to see 
if we could both see it. Both tests were successful.

16. ssh -X arpit@169.232.122.177
This command allowed me to SSH in with the capability to open other programs such as Firefox.

17. firefox
This command allowed me to test to see if firefox would open, and it successfully did.
