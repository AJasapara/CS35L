1. Yes, our network is still secure. The idea behind assymetric encryption 
is that first all the data would be encrypted using the receiver's public 
key, and then when the data is received by the intended party, it will be 
decrypted using the private key. Since the other malicious party does not have 
the private key, it will simply come off as meaningless junk to them.

However, if the other teams had tapped our keyboards, then no, the network would 
not be secure. Since they have access to our keystrokes, they can see what 
keystrokes are associated with the passphrase for the private key. Moreover, they 
can reverse engineer the decryption key by comparing the keystrokes to the 
encrypted data. Thus, they would have the means to decrypt and have access to the 
data.

Similarly, if the other teams had control of the USB, they would have access to 
the .ssh folders where we have kept the RSA keys. Thus, they would obtain all of 
the public and private keys, and can decrypt all of our data. So, no the network 
would not be secure.

2. gpg --verify would not necessarily be correct because it just compares the decrypted 
signature to the decrypted data. If this tar file were intercepted, and somehow my key 
was used to decrypt it, that person could simply change the data and then encrypt it 
with their own signature. This command will then verify that the signature matches the 
decrypted data, but then there is no way of knowing who the original owner was. This 
command will simply verify the integrity of the file, not the origin.

A common solution to this problem is to use a trusted third party organization. This 
organization can issue a certificate at time of sending, and if this certificate 
has been changed upon receiving the file, we will know that tampering has occurred.
