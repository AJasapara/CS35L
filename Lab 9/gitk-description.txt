The top left window shows a hierarchical tree of commits. The commit messages and the relationships between branches are shown.

The top middle window shows who made the commit in the respective row in the top left window and their email address.

The top right window shows the date of the commit in the respective row in the top left window.

The bottom left window shows the ChangeLog of the commit with some additional information. The buttons above this window allow you to configure the view and format.
The diff will show you the difference in the normal diff/patch format. The old version will show the old version, and the new version will show the new version.

The bottom right window shows the names of the files that were changed if the button 'Patch' above the window is selected. However, if 'Tree' is selected, then 
the bottom right window shows the contents of the directory and its subdirectories at the time of the commit. Selecting this option, also changes the bottom LEFT window, 
where instead of displaying the changes made to the files in any format (diff/old/new), it will only display the ChangeLog entry.
