1. emacs hw9.txt
I ran this command to create hw9.txt to explain what I did during this homework.

2. git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'
I ran this command to check into a new branch called "quote".

3. patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt 
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

The patch ran successfully.

4. C-x 4 a
I opened emacs and tested this command to see how it adds an entry for the current file in the ChangeLog.

5. ChangeLog entries:
emacs src/cmp.c
C-x 4 a
emacs src/diff.c
C-x 4 a
emacs src/diff3.c
C-x 4 a
emacs src/dir.c
C-x 4 a
emacs src/sdiff.c
C-x 4 a
emacs src/util.c
C-x 4 a
I added the appropriate ChangeLog entries for each file.

6. git commit -aF src/ChangeLog
I committed using the ChangeLog as my commit message.

7. git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
This command created formatted-patch.txt as specified in the spec.

8. git checkout -b 'partner1' 'v3.0'
This command let me check into a new branch 'partner'.

git am sanketh-patch.txt
Applying: 2017-06-03 Sanketh Sharath Hegde <sanketh@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>
This command applied his patch and ran successfully.

./bootstrap
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff
./configure
make
make check

I ran these commands as in the lab so I can confirm that his patch changed the grave accents and apostrophes appropriately.

src/diff . -
src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

src/diff --help
...
FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE... DIR'.
...

I ran these commands to check if the patch worked. Since there are no grave accents we can see that the patch did indeed work.

9. make distdir
cd diffutils-3.0.1-fd7a

I ran these commands so that I can verify my partner's ChangeLog file.

emacs ChangeLog

This is the first and most recent entry in the ChangeLog which is appropriate since my partner was the last to modify the patch. His ChangeLog entry is verified.

I was unsure if the spec was asking me to verify my ChangeLog or my partner's ChangeLog so I repeated Steps 8 and 9 to verify my ChangeLog entry:
2017-06-04  Arpit Deepak Jasapara  <arpit@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>

                * dir.c: Reverted apostrophe to grave accent in the comments.

                * diff.c: Reverted apostrophe to grave accent in the comments.

                * cmp.c: Reverted apostrophe to grave accent in the comments.

This is the first and most recent entry in the ChangeLog which is appropriate since I was the last to modify the patch. My ChangeLog entry is verified.

10. I downloaded Xming, and installed it, so I could run an X server on my laptop. Then I changed PuTTY to allow X11 forwarding so gitk would open.

cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk

I went into this directory and entered the command gitk as specified in the spec. I then found the newest merge that is not newer than 2015-01-25:
Merge branch 'master' into xwidget

I then took a screenshot and briefly described the roles of the subwindows in gitk-description.txt.
