1. man -k, then enter the specific word you're searching for.
I used man man to find this in the manual for man.

2. cp is in /usr/bin/cp and wc is in /usr/bin/wc
I used whereis cp and whereis wc respectively to find their locations.

3. I found 3 executables that are 1 character long:
w (in /usr/bin/w and it shows who is logged on/what they are doing)
X (in /usr/bin/X and it is a window system)
[ (in /usr/bin/[ and it is bash built-in commands)

I found these by typing in whatis ? in the /usr/bin directory.

4. /etc/alternatives/emacs
I used cd /usr/bin to find emacs,
which is shown as redirecting to /etc/alternatives/emacs

5. g+s passes on the Group ID to all new files and subdirectories,
and o-x removes the execute permission from the others class.
I used man chmod to find out what these attributes do.

6. -mtime 21
I used man find | grep modif to find lines pertaining to modifying for find.

7. find -mtime 21 -type d will list all the directories.
Since there are too many to list,
I assumed we were not supposed to list them here.
I used man find | grep dir to find the lines pertaining to directories.

8. 247
I used man wc to see how to count lines,
then used find -type l | wc -l to get the count of symbolic links.

9.libfreeblpriv3.so from June 28, 2016, making it the oldest regular file.
I used C-x d to open up dired, navigated to /usr/lib,
and pressed s to sort by time.
I then used M-> to move to the end of the buffer,
and scrolled up till I found the first regular file.

On the other hand, if you were asking for the oldest regular file in /usr/lib
AND its SUBDIRECTORIES, then it would be crt1.o in
/usr/lib/x86_64-redhat-linux6E/lib64. The file is from January 24, 2014,
and there are a number of files in this directory that are from the same date.
I found this file by going through all the directories (mostly empty) from the
bottom until encountering the oldest regular file.

10. /usr/share/i18n/locales
I used man locale to read up on where locale gets its data from.

11. There are 9 commands:
Buffer-menu-sort
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields
tabulated-list-col-sort

I used C-h a "sort" to find all the commands with sort in their name.

12. Yes I can list them concisely:
A defun is a top-level major definition.
C-M-a moves to beginning of the current or preceding defun.
C-M-b moves backwards one balanced expression.
C-M-c exits the recursive edit.
C-M-d moves down one level of parentheses.
C-M-e moves to the end of the current or following defun.
C-M-f moves forward one balanced expression.
C-M-h puts a mark at the end of a function definition,
and puts the point at the beginning.

I used C-h K and then typed in the respective keys (C-M-a, C-M-b, etc.)

13. Quits the current running or partially typed command.
It is equivalent to the command keyboard-quit.
I used C-h K C-g to find the description.

14. It pastes the last killed text into the buffer, at the point.
I used C-h a "yank" to find the yank function.

15. Emacs lists the . and .. directories, whereas ls -l doesn't.
Emacs also has a more descriptive first line about space saying
"total used in directory 297196 available 13493736",
whereas ls -l just says "total 297120"
